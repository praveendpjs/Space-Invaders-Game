# Space-Invaders-Game
This is a space shooting game using pygame. I explained most of the codes in the comments itself. Player is provided with 3 lives and 100 health bar. Each time he collides with enemy he loses 10 health points. So if player gets hit 10 times the game ends and you lose. You will win if you clear five levels. You lose if enemy passes you three times.
